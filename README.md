Abstract:

Trust in vaccination is eroding, and attitudes about vaccination have become more polarized. To shed light on the evolution of social media discourse about vaccines in the context of the COVID pandemic, we conducted an observational study of Twitter vaccine discourse 75 days prior to and after the World Health Organizationâ€™s 11 March 2020 pandemic declaration. We report four  main findings. First, the amount of vaccine discourse greatly increased over the course of the pandemic. Second, the two existing vaccine-focused camps  were joined by a massive influx of by partisan American political accounts. Antivaxxers solidified   alliances with Republicans, and Public Health organisations with  Democrats, increasing interaction and signal boosting. We also detect a smaller community of Unorthodox users who are more ambivalent about vaccines; this community moves towards the political right after the declaration. Finally, the evolution of both the moral and the non-moral language used by these groups follows pre-existing patterns of trust, suggesting a trust-first model of political engagement.
